**Customer Segmentation Analysis**
This repository contains the code and analysis for a Customer Segmentation Analysis project. The primary goal of this project is to leverage transactional data to understand customer purchasing patterns, segment the customer base, and tailor personalized marketing strategies, such as coupons, to re-engage and retain customers.

**Project Overview**
Customer segmentation is a critical component of marketing and business strategy. By grouping customers with similar purchasing behaviors, businesses can:

Improve marketing ROI through targeted campaigns.
Enhance customer experiences with personalized offers.
Optimize product recommendations and inventory planning.
This project utilizes RFM analysis and Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to identify customer segments and uncover purchasing patterns.

**Key Features**
RFM Analysis: Segmentation based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
Market Basket Analysis: Association rule mining to identify product purchase patterns and frequently bought-together items.
Customer Segmentation: Clustering techniques to create actionable customer groups.
Data Visualization: Insights presented with interactive charts and graphs.

**Project Workflow**
Data Collection: Transactional data sourced from a hypothetical retail environment.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, anomalies, and key patterns.
RFM Segmentation:
Scoring customers on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
Grouping customers into actionable segments.
Market Basket Analysis:
Applying association rule mining to find frequent itemsets.
Deriving insights for cross-selling and upselling.
Visualization and Reporting: Summarizing insights with plots and dashboards.

**Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and Tools:
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Clustering: Scikit-learn
- Market Basket Analysis: MLxtend
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
